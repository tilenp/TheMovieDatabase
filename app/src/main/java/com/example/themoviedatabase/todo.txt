handle error while loading movie details
split screens into "protected" chunks
split MovieRepository
remove idle in tests
modularize, starting times are getting slow
move open youtube into MovieDetailsScreen
Use the MovieItemImage in MoviesScreen as well
maybe remove cache and use SavedStateHandel (convert livedata into flow)

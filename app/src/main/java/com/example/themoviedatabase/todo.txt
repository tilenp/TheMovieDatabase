use errorBuilder for MovieDetails state
rename backup field int ImagePath into resourceId
make fields in UI data visible for testing, remove equals implementation
fix movie details loading (looks weird)
split movie repository
remove idle in tests
check class names
try to emit MovieDetailsState.builder instead the stete itself
set snackbar theme
maybe remove cache and use SavedStateHandel (convert livedata into flow)
